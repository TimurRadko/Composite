It has survived - not only (five) centuries, but also the leap into [13_2_+] electronic typesetting, remaining [3_5_*] essentially [6_1_-] unchanged.

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using [8_2_/_6_+] Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using (Content here), content here, making it look like readable English.
It is a [20_5_/_1_-] established fact that a reader will be of a page when looking at its layout.
Bye.
